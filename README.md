Social Network — Registration Interface

The registration interface of the social network was developed with a focus on security, efficiency, and a smooth user experience. It includes:

Complete field validation: all user inputs, such as name, email, and password, are validated in real-time to ensure correct formatting before submission.

Email validation: the system checks the structure and validity of the email to avoid incomplete or incorrect domains.

Data management: user data is handled in an organized and secure way, ready for back-end integration and consistent storage.
